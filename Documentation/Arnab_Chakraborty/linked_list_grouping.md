# Grouping
[**Problem Link**](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/blob/master/5.%20Linked%20List/grouping/grouping.md)

*This is a medium level problem where we are given a*
**Linked List**
*and we are asked to rearrange that list keeping all even indices at the front and then all the odd indices*
*It won't be that easy to solve as we would have done in arrays,because here there is a reference attached with every node*
*hence it would be difficult to rearrange it.Here we would go by the Brute force approach,we would store the even and odd position values in 2 separate arraylist and then create a separate linked* 
*list with the required arrangement from that arraylist.*

**Time Complexity-O(N)**

**Space Complexity-O(N)**
