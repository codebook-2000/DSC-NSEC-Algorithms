# Mid
[**Problem Link**](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/blob/master/5.%20Linked%20List/mid/mid.md)

*This is a very simple problem where we are asked to find the mid point of a*
**Linked List.**
*Here we Initialize head node.Traverse the linked list to find the size() of the list.Find mid point of that list by dividing the size()*
*by 2 then+1.Then traverse the Linked List to the mid point and then return the data of mid point.*
*As simple as that!*

**Time Complexity-O(N)**

**Space Complexity-O(N)**
