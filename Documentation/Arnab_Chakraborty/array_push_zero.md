# Push Zero
[**Problem Link**](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/blob/master/1.%20Array/push_zero/push_zero.md)

*The Problem tells us to shift all zeroes to the end without disturbing the original arrangement.This can be done in many ways,*
*but we should devise the most efficient one.So traverse the array from index 0 to N-1 and whatever non-zero elements we encounter,we push them*
*to the beginning of the same array,without disturbing the order.At the end we would automatically get the array,which we want,because*
*we have pushed all the non-zero to the first of the array,therefore we are only left with the zeroes now* 

**Time Complexity-O(n)**
**Space Complexity-O(1)**
