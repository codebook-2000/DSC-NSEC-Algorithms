/**
 * @file task_prerequisite_harikrishnan.cpp
 * @brief We have to determine if all tasks can be done or not, given that some tasks have some another tasks as prerequisites.
 *
 * Description -  Let us consider all tasks as  nodes of the graph, and also let a node be directed from another node, which is a prerequisite for the former node(task).  
 *  Now we need to check if there is a topological order of the nodes in the directed graph. If there is then the answer would be "YES".
 * Every graph without a cycle has a topological order of nodes and vice versa. Hence the problem reduces to check if a cycle exist in a graph or not. 
 *
 *
 * Time Complexity - O(N+K) Space Complexity - O(N)
