for solving this problem, first of all we will check if the both string's size same or not, if same, then we will procced for next but if they are not same at that possition we will decleare it as "NO"
<p align="center">
if(n!=m)
    return false;
</p> <br>

as next process we will check, if all of the cheracture of both of the srrings are same or not,if same then we will go for next checking,  then we will check the charecture in acyclick order, if they are same, it will print YES otherwise NO.

<p align="center">
if(n!=m)
    return false;
