# Unique Character
[**Problem Link**](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/blob/master/2.%20String/unique_char/unique_char.md)

*We are given a String and we have to return the index of the first occurence of the character which appears only once in the*
*String.*
*To do this we would first convert the string into the array of characters,Calculate the count of each letter in a count array.Then run a loop from 0 to n-1, and check for*
*each character if its count==1 or not.If yes, then return the first such encountered character's index.If no such*
*character found return -1.*

**Time Complexity-O(N)**

**Space Complexity-O(N)**
